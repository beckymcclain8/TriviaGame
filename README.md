# TriviaGame
This is a Harry Potter themed trivia game.  It has a timer on each question, so the user only has 10 seconds to answer each question.  The game will let you know after each question whether you have answered correctly, incorrectly, or if you ran out of time.  It will also display a picture and tell you the correct answer if you didn't get it right.
